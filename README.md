## Introduction

Welcome to the Free LLM Chatbot FastAPI repository! This project is aimed at creating a chatbot using FastAPI that leverages the GPT-3.5 language model to provide natural language understanding and generation capabilities.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing:** Utilizes GPT-3.5, a powerful language model developed by OpenAI, to process and generate human-like text responses.
- **FastAPI Web Interface:** Provides a user-friendly web interface powered by FastAPI for interacting with the chatbot.
- **Customizable:** You can easily customize the chatbot's behavior, responses, and conversation flow to suit your specific use case.
- **Open Source:** This project is open-source and encourages contributions from the community.
